## Process Scheduling and Memory Management Simulator

Program investigates performance of a variety of scheduling and memory management algorithms used within an Operating System's kernel. For a much more
detailed outline of the project, see ` project2.pdf`. See `report.txt` for a short explanation of the custom scheduling and memory management
algorithms and the situations where they perform better.

#### Scheduling Algorithms Implemented:
* First come first served
* Round robin
* Custom Scheduler: Shortest first

#### Memory Management Algorithms Implemented:
* Swapping X
* Virtual Memory
* Custom Memory Management: Fair Memory Allocation
